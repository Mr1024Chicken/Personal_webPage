            <h1>Vision</h1>
            This project was sponsored by the nursing department of UTA. Their goal is to create a virtual reality simulation to train nursing
            students for palliative care on a patient with a terminal illness. The students will go through four scenarios in total and our team
            will be working on the second scenario, where the student will focus on care at the patient's home. The outcome of the simulation should
            have the student gain real life experience that they would not be able to get from a textbook.

            <h1>Purpose</h1>
            The VR Education Sim: Hospice (level 2) will introduce the user to a housing environment, where the user will help care for the patient.
            The first goal for the user in this level is to identify hazardous scenario. The task will require the student to move around the environment to access
            the house situation. By giving the student a first person experience in care giving this simulation can help student gain experience significantly compare
            to the traditional method that involve mannequin.
